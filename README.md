# Hotel-menu
This project is a C-based Hotel Menu Ordering and Billing System designed to simulate a real-world restaurant billing experience. It allows users to select food items, enter quantities, calculate item-wise costs, and generate a complete final bill. The system also includes a simple payment selection interface (Cash/Card or Online).
